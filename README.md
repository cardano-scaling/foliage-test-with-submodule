# Testing repository for [foliage](https://github.com/input-output-hk/foliage)

This repository contains a haskell package serving as a test fixture for
foliage. Besides being on github and needing to be fetched from here, it also
contains a submodule.

This was motivated by https://github.com/input-output-hk/foliage/issues/88
